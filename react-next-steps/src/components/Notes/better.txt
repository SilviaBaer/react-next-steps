*** *** *** JSX LIMITATIONS & WORKAROUNDS *** *** ***

- you cannot return more than one "root" JSX element
- you cannot store more than one "root" JSX element in a a var
- solutions: (they all work the same!!)

    - DIV ELEMENT
    . :) wrap with a div element or custom component
    . :( wrapping div soup: there are there without any semantic so browser could be slowed down (ok but no ideal)

    - WRAPPER COMPONENT 
    react-next-steps\src\components\Helpers\Wrapper.js

    - FRAGMENTS
    . <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
    . <> </>


*** *** *** PORTALS *** *** *** 

- rendering in case of nested h2 can be confusing and hard to read
- style a button with a div and and event listener ... it works but ... meh 
- cfr. modal
- the code looks like it renders in the same way, IRL it is just rendered in a different DOM


*** *** *** WORKING WITH REF'S *** *** ***

- they allow us to access to the portals 
- useRef hook only usable in a functional component
- connecting ref with an HTML element
- ref prop inside the HTML element 


*** *** *** UNCONTROLLED COMPONENTS *** *** ***
