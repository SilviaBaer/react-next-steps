REACT APP JOBS SO FAR: (something on the screen)
- render UI
- react user input
- re-render UI when needed
function that runs every time the state differs

SIDE EFFECTS: EVERYTHING ELSE!!! 
- store data in browser storage
- send HTTP req to backend servers 
- set & manage timers
These happens outside the normal component function and evaluation

handling Side Effects with useEffect() hook

useEffect(() => {...}, [dependencies]);

- A function that should be executed AFTER every component evaluation IF the specified dependencies changed
  Only when dependencies change, not just when the component is re-rendered!!  
    - SIDE EFFECT CODE GOES HERE!! - 

- An array with dependencies. When they change the first function re-runs
    - DEPENDENCIES OF THE FUNCTION GOES HERE!! -
